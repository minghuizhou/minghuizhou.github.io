Welcome! I' am a Tenured Professor in [PKU](https://www.pku.edu.cn/)'s [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/) and a member of the [Software Engineering Institute](http://www.sei.pku.edu.cn/). I lead [Open Source Software Data Analytics Lab](https://osslab-pku.github.io/) working on empirical software engineering and open source ecosystems.

Research Interest
===================
I'm interested in observing software repositories and measuring how developers live their lives with the hope that could help understand and control large complex software systems, society, and universe. I'm looking for students who are interested in mining software engineering data, or learning data analysis techniques, or conducting research on digital archeology/sociology, or making the world a better place with small steps, to work with.
